//! PTS pacing for the video pump: smooths the timestamps fed to the decoder against

//! rather than stamped with ~the same time. Ports aurora-tv's `SS4S_SMOOTH_PACING`
//! stack (`ndl_player.c`) — reconciled interval, host-PTS anchoring, and drift-clamped
//! smoothing. Enabled only when the frame-pacing setting is on (see [`crate::session`]).
