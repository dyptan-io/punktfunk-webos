//! Adaptive triggers, lightbar and player LEDs on a real `DualSense`, over webOS's
//! Bluetooth HID plane.
//!
//! **Why this route exists.** SDL's own `DualSense` support (`SDL_GameControllerSendEffect`,
//! present in the bundled fork) drives the pad through `/dev/hidraw*`, and a webOS app's jail
//! exposes no hidraw node at all — not even with the pad connected, and with no `hidraw`
//! class in `/sys` either (verified on webOS 10.3, non-rooted; see `docs/NOTES.md`). So the
//! effect bytes cannot go through SDL. What *is* reachable is the TV's own Bluetooth stack:
//! `com.webos.service.bluetooth2/hid/internal/sendData` writes an arbitrary HID output report
//! to a connected HID device, and it sits in the `public` API group a dev-mode install
//! already holds — no root required.
//!
//! Two hard-won details, both verified on-device:
//!   * the payload carries `reportData` as an int array **with no `reportId` field** — adding
//!     one makes the service reject the call with a generic schema error that names nothing,
//!     and `setReport` (the method that *does* take a report id) always answers "operation can
//!     not be performed at this time";
//!   * the report needs the same CRC32 the kernel's `hid-playstation` appends, over a `0xA2`
//!     seed byte. Without it the pad silently ignores a call the service reports as success.
//!
//! Rumble deliberately does **not** go through here: it reaches the pad as ordinary evdev
//! force feedback via SDL (`GameController::set_rumble`), which works for every controller
//! type rather than only this one. Reports built here never set the vibration valid-flag, so
//! they cannot fight the kernel's force-feedback state — see [`build_report`].
