//! Best-effort TV tuning for low input latency during a stream.
//!
//! webOS's own ALLM is an HDMI-plane feature — it never reaches a native app painting the
//! app/video plane, so the app-side equivalent is to drive the same TV settings ALLM would:
//! the Game *picture* mode (LG's "Game Optimizer", the real latency win), the Game *sound*
//! mode, and — for HDR — max Peak Brightness so an HDR game isn't dimmed.
//!
//! **Why via the Homebrew Channel and not `settingsservice` directly.** `com.webos.settingsservice`
//! grants the public bus NO access at all — `luna-send-pub` gets `Access denied` on both get
//! and set, and an app-identity call is "not privileged" (verified on-device, webOS 10.3). Only
//! a root private-bus caller may write these. So on a webosbrew-rooted set we hand the privileged
//! `luna-send` to `org.webosbrew.hbchannel.service`'s `exec` method, which runs it as root and
//! returns its stdout — reachable from the public bus. On a TV without the Homebrew Channel this
//! simply fails and is logged; the feature stays behind the Experimental toggle for that reason.
