//! Minimal one-shot Luna (webOS service bus) caller, used by [`crate::platform::webos::dualsense`].
//!
//! **Why a subprocess and not `libluna-service2` directly.** In-process `LSCall` needs a
//! registered `LSHandle` attached to a running `GMainLoop`, and — the deciding factor — LS2
//! authorizes a caller by *which executable* is calling: permissions come from the role file
//! matched to the binary's path (`/usr/share/luna-service2/roles.d/`). `luna-send-pub`'s own
//! role is what was verified on-device to reach the Bluetooth HID methods from a dev-mode
//! install; an app registering under its own name is a different, unverified client identity.
//! Borrowing the tool's identity is the difference between "works on a non-rooted TV" and
//! "works only where someone already granted our appid the `devices` group".
//!
//! Cost is one fork/exec per call, which is why nothing here is on a hot path: the only
//! caller coalesces to the latest state and sends from its own thread (see
//! [`crate::platform::webos::dualsense::Feedback`]). Never call this from the render/input loop.
