//! Shared open/close fade bookkeeping for modal-like overlays — the pre-stream `App`'s
//! `Screen` modals and the in-stream disconnect dialog both use one of these so every
//! dialog in the app opens/closes on the same clock and curve instead of each re-deriving
//! it (see `docs/NOTES.md` for why that drifted apart once: the disconnect dialog and
//! stats overlay live in `main.rs`'s streaming loop, which has no `App`/`Screen` to hook).
